            <h2>Silly Clauses</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>No Warranty of Salutation Satisfaction:</strong> There is no guarantee that saying "Hello, World!"
                    to your screen will bring you any measure of happiness, self-fulfillment, or a sense of existential
                    completeness.</li>
                <li><strong>Inter-Galactic Laws Apply:</strong> By accessing this Website, you acknowledge that inter-galactic
                    laws may be invoked if you are not of this Earth. This may or may not involve debates on the appropriate
                    spelling of "Hello" in your star system.</li>
                <li><strong>Random Acts of Code:</strong> Beware that any refresh, hot reload, or exasperated smack on your
                    keyboard may or may not trigger an alternate version of the Website in which the Phrase may include random
                    emojis, ASCII art, or ancient runes.</li>
            </ol>
